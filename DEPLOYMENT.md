# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues

This deployment fixes several critical issues that were causing white screen problems on Vercel:

### 1. **Error Boundaries**
- Added comprehensive error boundary component
- Graceful fallback rendering when components fail
- Better error reporting in development mode

### 2. **Vercel Configuration**
- Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing for SPA
- Added asset caching headers
- Security headers for better protection

### 3. **Build Optimization**
- Improved Vite configuration for production builds
- Code splitting for better performance
- Proper chunk optimization

### 4. **CSS Fallbacks**
- Added fallback styles for critical CSS variables
- Ensured fonts load properly with system fallbacks
- Better color variable handling

### 5. **Runtime Error Handling**
- Enhanced `main.tsx` with error catching
- Fallback HTML rendering if React fails
- Health check component for monitoring

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run vercel-build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check that all routes work (/, /services, /portfolio, /careers, /contact)
   - Ensure no white screen appears
   - Test error boundaries by opening browser dev tools

## Key Files Modified

- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added error boundary
- `client/src/main.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- `client/src/index.css` - Added CSS fallbacks
- `vite.config.ts` - Optimized build configuration
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts

## Monitoring

The app now includes:
- Health check indicator (green dot in bottom-right)
- Error boundary with retry functionality
- Console error logging
- Fallback rendering for critical failures

## Troubleshooting

If you still see white screen:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all assets are loading (Network tab)
3. Check Vercel function logs
4. Ensure all environment variables are set

## Testing Locally

```bash
npm run vercel-build
npm run preview
```
